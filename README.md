# Conways-Game-of-Life
Developed using python 3.8

I made this as a tribute to John Conway who recently passed away due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Here is the description of the game from Wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life):
    The Game of Life, also known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton devised
    by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970.
    It is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input.
    One interacts with the Game of Life by creating an initial configuration and observing how it evolves.
    It is Turing complete and can simulate a universal constructor or any other Turing machine.
